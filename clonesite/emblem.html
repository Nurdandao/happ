        <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.03a733ed9203c5fcbfad0dddcef2902c?rik=55BrFF3Em9Ne8A&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" width="210">
        <div class="pcenter">
        <p>The coat of arms is one of the main symbols of the state. The coat of arms (“coat of arms”) comes from the German word” erbe ” (heritage). It is a hereditary distinctive sign of harmonious forms and objects of symbolic significance, reflecting the cultural and historical traditions of the state.</p>

        <p>History shows that the nomads of the Bronze Age, who inhabited the territory of modern Kazakhstan, identified themselves with a special symbol-totem, which was later called “Tamba”. For the first time, this term was used during the Turkic Khaganate.</p>
            
        <p>The coat of arms of sovereign Kazakhstan was officially adopted in 1992. Its authors are famous architects Zhandarbek Malibekov and shot-Aman Ualikhanov.</p>
            
        <p>The state emblem of the Republic of Kazakhstan has the shape of a circle. It is a symbol of life and eternity, especially revered by the nomads of the Great Steppe.</p>
            
        <p>The central heraldic element of the state emblem is the image of shanyrak (the upper domed part of the yurt) on a blue background. Uyks spread around the shanyrak like sunlight. On the right and left sides of the shanyrak there is an image of mythical winged horses. In the upper part there is a three – dimensional five-pointed star, and in the lower part there is an inscription “Qazaqstan”. The image of the star, shanyrak, uyks, mythical horses, as well as the inscription “Qazaqstan”-the color of gold.</p>
            
        <p>Shanyrak is the main system – forming part of the yurt, which resembles the blue dome and is one of the main sources of life in the traditional culture of the Nomads of Eurasia. The image of shanyrak on the national coat of arms of the Republic is a symbol of a common settlement, a common homeland of all peoples inhabiting our country. Just as the strength and strength of shanyrak depends on the reliability of all its uyks, the success of happiness in Kazakhstan depends on the well-being of every citizen.</p>
            
        <p>Winged tulpars in The Legend are an actual heraldic element in the national coat of arms. The image of a horse in modern times shows courage, confidence and willpower. The wings of the pyrak reflect the centuries-old desire of the multinational people of Kazakhstan to build a strong and prosperous state. They are the embodiment of true thoughts and aspirations for continuous improvement and creative development. At the same time, the golden wings of argymak resemble golden ears, symbolize the hard work of Kazakhstanis and the material well-being of the country.</p>
            
        <p>In the past centuries, the Horn was actively used in nomadic cult rituals, as well as for installation on the tip of the battle flag. The image of the gift of heaven, the good of the Earth, and the victory of the campaign through the horns of various animals has taken a significant place in the symbolic compositions of many peoples. Therefore, the winged tulpar with horns that bring abundance is considered an important typological image with deep semantic and historical roots.</p>
            
        <p>Another detail in the national coat of arms of the Republic is a five – pointed star. This symbol has been used by mankind since ancient times, it symbolizes the constant desire of people to the ray of truth, all noble aspirations and eternal values. The image of the star on the national emblem indicates the desire of Kazakhstanis to become a country that intends to establish cooperation and partnership with all the peoples of the world. The hearts and arms of the people of Kazakhstan are always open to representatives of the five continents.</p>
            
        <p>The main color used in the coat of arms is the color of gold. It is a symbol of wealth, justice and generosity. At the same time, the color of the flag in the color of the blue sky is combined with the color of gold, representing the concepts of Clear Sky, peace and well-being.</p>
